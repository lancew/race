OK...

this is just a playground for me learning a little elm.
The idea is to create a web display of a simple yacht race.

Yachts have to get from left to right, over a 24 week time line.
Their should be some sort of "ghost ship" that shows where they would be if
on simple distance/24 weeks schedule.

UI... 
1. Week increment/decrement
2. Yacht 1, travel ++/--
3. Yacht 2, travel ++/--
4. Yacht 3, travel ++/--
5. Reset.

Nice to have...
1. Persistant storage in browser
2. Persistence storage via API

Lets go!!
